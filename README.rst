Let's say you have the following output from ``git status``:

::

  $ git status

  On branch master
  Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
    (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

    api.py
    tests/api/
    tests/test_board.py

  nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)


Running ``pytest --picked``, the plugin will run all tests that come from this output.

::

  $ pytest --picked
